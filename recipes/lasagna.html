    <h3><b>Description</b></h3>
    <p>
        This classic lasagna recipe is the ultimate comfort food. Made with rich tomato-meat sauce, three cheeses, and Italian spices, it’s easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser! 
    </p>
    <p>
        For over a decade, this homemade lasagna recipe was a staple in our catering business, from small gatherings to corporate events. I can’t tell you how many people told us that this was the best lasagna they’d ever had!

Eventually, this became the meal I would make family and friends who needed a home-cooked meal dropped off when life became overwhelming, or there was a hardship.

    <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of Italian sausage (I use lean ground beef)</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced (more if you love garlic as much as we do)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole basil (I use dry and it works fine)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 (6-ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (1-pound) can of tomatoes (I now use the large 28-ounce can of diced tomatoes)</li>
        <li>10 ounces lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3 cups fresh Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (I use Kraft grated Parmesan in the green can, but you can use fresh if you like)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons parsley flakes (dried works fine)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced very thin or grated (I’ve gotten lazy over the years and now buy my mozzarella pre-grated)</li>
</ul>

    <h3><b>Steps</b></h3>

    <ol>
       
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 F.</li>
    <li>Brown meat slowly. Spoon off excess fat.</li>
    <li>Add the next five ingredients and 1 cup of water. Simmer, covered, 15 minutes. Stir often.</li>
    <li>Cook noodles in boiling salted water till tender. Drain and rinse.</li>
    <li>Beat eggs and add the remaining ingredients, except the mozzarella. (I have this going while I'm making the sauce).</li>
    <li>Layer half the noodles in a 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Spread with half the Ricotta filling, add half the mozzarella cheese, and half the meat sauce. Repeat.</li>
    <li>Cover with foil and bake at 375 for about 30–45 minutes. Remove foil for the last 10 minutes. I usually save some of the grated mozzarella and melt that on top during that last 10 minutes until it gets nice and bubbly.</li>
    <li>You can also assemble early and refrigerate. If you do this, bake it for one hour.</li>
    <li>Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    <li>Serves: 8–10</li>
